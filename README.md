This mini project uses the python package tkinter to make a pomodoro technique timer. The pomodoro study technique consists of 25 minutes of study then 5 minutes of a break and when 4 cycles of this is done, a 20 minute break begins. An image was added in the background to add aesthetic appeal. The timer can be started and reset whenever the user would like and the text above the timer indicates whether it is a work period or a break period. The code runs as shown below and the timer was reduced for demonstration purposes.
