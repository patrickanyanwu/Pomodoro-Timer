This mini project uses the python package tkinter to make a pomodoro techniqure timer. The pomodoro study technique consists of 25 minutes of stude then 5 minutes of a break and when 4 cycles of this is done then it is a 20 minute break. An image was added in the background to add aesthetic appeal to it. The timer can be started and reset whenever the user would like to and the text above the timer indicates wether it is a work period or a break period. The code runs as shown below, I reduced the timer for demonstration purposes.
